Project Name:
Duck Duck Goose

Business Context:
- Dating apps have become stale and corporate. They all do the same thing with few unique  features. Dating apps have become a standard app used by most single adults who feel it is the only way to
meet people. Most apps are the same as each other with minimal variety. We hope to change this.

Problem Statment:
- Modern dating apps have created an illusion of infiniate choice that encourages people to keep swiping endlessly and becoming overly picky rather than making sacrafices required for a 
healthy relationship. Our app will app will create limited, high-stakes matching that will maximize engagement and will help encourage people opposed to leading them to burn out caused
by most dating apps. Encourages authentic connections and is meant to lead to real life connections.

Scope:
- profile features

- matching features

- chatting features

Out of scope:
- We will not incorporate other social media onto the platform

- Premium will not be in the scope of this first 

- Any kind of credit card handling

Assumptions:
- Users have software able to take and submit photos

- Users will either have service or a strong wifi connection


Features:
- Create an Account:
	name, age, hobbies, interest, and pictures.

- Database and Algortihm:
	System will take this information and compare profiles with the goal of matching people based on similar traits. We will do this by employing a similarity machine learning algorithm


- Matching feature:
	Matching can only happen when you've logged into your account. Unlike other apps, our matching will be if you swipe goose.
	Two buttons on either side. One with a duck and one with a goose. Swipe goose to match, duck will act as a not interested button

- Chatting Feature:
	Once users swipe towards the goose on someone, they will be able to send a short message. If that person also swipes that way, they will start a DM chain and 
	be able to message back and forth.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- System will run on modern browsers:

- System will be able to query next potential match within 3 seconds

- System will not allow users younger than 18

- Needs to scale to allow multiple people on at the same time

- System will be availble 24/7 other than system updates which will be announced beforehand.
